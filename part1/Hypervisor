What is Hypervisor ??
Hypervisor is a software which is used to create and manage virtual machines.
A virtualization layer allows us to run different OS on our host OS . 
Like if we have windows OS so we can macos and linux in it using virtualization( by create vms for each os on our host os)
Hypervisors is of two types 
1) Type 1 (Bare Metal)
   -- In this type we add hypervisor directly to the hardware. for ex VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Citrix Hypervisor (formerly XenServer), and Xen Project/XCP-ng.
2) Type 2 (Hosted)
   -- In this type we add hypervisor in the present OS(Host OS) so that we can run other OS from the host OS. for ex 
  VMware Workstation, VMware Fusion, Oracle VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop.

Features of using Virtualization 
1) Cheap
2) Reduce cost for multiple OS
3) Can Test an application from the same OS(Windows) for other OS (Linux, MacOS etc).
